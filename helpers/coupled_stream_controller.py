# Summary:
# - Lightweight QObject that couples image packets with mocap packets using sample-and-hold.
# - What it does: buffers recent rigid body packets, receives image packets, and emits a
#   coupled packet only when the newest rigid body sample at-or-before the image timestamp
#   exists and is within the configured stale threshold.
# - Input: constructed with max allowed timestamp difference and buffer length.
# - Returns: QObject instance that emits coupled packet signals for recording.
